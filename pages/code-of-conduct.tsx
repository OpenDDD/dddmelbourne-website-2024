        bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

      <h2>Enforcement</h2>

      <Text>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to:</Text>

      <StyledList>
        <li>
          Listen to the complaint with an open mind and consider the effect rather than intent of the behaviour in
          question
        </li>
        <li>Not be dismissive of the complainant</li>
        <li>Understand any advice given on how to act in the future</li>
        <li>Comply with the directions of the {conference.Name} organisers</li>
      </StyledList>

      <Text>
        If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep
        the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
        conference with no refund.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the
        event or making the environment hostile for any participants.{' '}
        <strong>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, event-related social activities as well as
          social media.
        </strong>
      </Text>

      <h2>Inclusivity</h2>

      <Text>
        In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it's important to pay
        attention to harmful language patterns.
      </Text>

      <h3>Ableism</h3>

      <Text>
        Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of <strong>ableist language</strong>, devaluating
        people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to
        offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more
        fitting, clearer descriptions of what we intend to communicate.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read{' '}

      </Text>

      <h3>Sexism</h3>

      <Text>
        Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering
        exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered
        terms.

      <Text>We will have colored lanyards for attendees to indicate their comfort level with being photographed:</Text>

          <strong>Green or Red:</strong> do not photograph
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other colours:</strong> fine to photograph
