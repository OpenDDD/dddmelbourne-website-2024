      <h1>About DDD Melbourne</h1>
      <Text>
        DDD Melbourne is an inclusive non-profit conference for the software community. Our goal is to create an
        approachable event that appeals to the whole community, especially people who usually donâ€™t have the opportunity
        to attend, or speak at, conferences. We do this by:
      </Text>
      <StyledList>
        <li>Making the ticket price as low as possible ({conference.TicketPrice})</li>
        <li>Running the event on a Saturday</li>
        <li>Allowing anyone to submit about any software industry related topic</li>
        <li>Having a democratically chosen agenda</li>
        <li>Focussing on creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is welcome</li>
        <li>Providing free childcare options for the duration of the main conference</li>
      </StyledList>
      <Text>
        Furthermore, {conference.Name} aims to both create opportunities for underrepresented minorities, juniors and
        first-time speakers to present as well as influence the wider software industry to encourage such opportunities
        more broadly.

      <h2>What does DDD stand for?</h2>
      <Text>
        DDD Melbourne started out its life as part of the Developer! Developer! Developer! series of events and while
        our heritage is as a developer-focussed conference, DDD Melbourne is not just for developers, but for all
        professionals in the software industry. These days we don't expand DDD - it's not an acronym for us anymore, but
        if people insist then we might say Designer, Developer and Data Scientist, or is it DevOps, Data architect,
        distributed tester?

        Developer! Developer! Developer! started in 2005 in the United Kingdom as a community conference organised by
        software developers for software developers.{' '}
