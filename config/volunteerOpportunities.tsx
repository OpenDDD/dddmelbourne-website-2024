      <Fragment>
        Once talks are chosen, we run training sessions for speakers to give them advice and tips on putting together
        and performing their presentation. These sessions usually have a few mentors who can give advice to speakers,
        or who can one-on-one pop out and go through things a bit more in-depth with a first time speaker if needed.

    RoleTitle: "üéÅ Speaker Gift Elves",
    Description: (
      <Fragment>
        Organising, planning, assembling and packing speaker gifts. This is a role that requires some time in the lead
        up to the conference. The gifts will be sourced already and there will be some time elected (probably in the
        evening) where a small group will come together with the committee member leading this initiative to assemble
        the packs. Important note, this is not a standalone role and will be coupled with an "on the day" operational role.
        Please advise if there are any roles that you specifcially do not want to be assigned. Or if you have another
        area of interest in an operational role on the day that would be a great help too!

        General assistance and working under the guidance of the team lead on the day. Ushers simply make stuff happen
        and are paramount to the effective running of the conference while things are in flight. From herding large

        using the nominated digial check-in tool. You will be required to attend a pre-event training session to ensure
        familiarity and your ability to work in a high pressure environment during the check-in period. The idea here
